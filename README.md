### **Day 31: Introduction to SystemVerilog**

**Concept Overview**  
SystemVerilog (SV) is a hardware description and verification language that builds upon Verilog. It adds powerful design and verification constructs to support complex hardware design, modeling, and simulation. SV is widely used in modern ASIC and FPGA development environments and verification methodologies like UVM.

**Why SystemVerilog?**  
- Provides high-level abstraction for modeling hardware  
- Enhances design readability and maintainability  
- Supports Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for verification  
- Adds new data types, control structures, and interfaces  
- Allows advanced testbench creation with classes, randomization, and coverage

**Key Differences from Verilog**  
- Enhanced data types (e.g., `logic`, `bit`, `byte`, `enum`, `struct`)  
- Advanced control flow (`foreach`, `unique`, `priority`)  
- Object-oriented verification features  
- New procedural blocks like `initial`, `always_ff`, `always_comb`  
- Rich assertions and constraints for functional coverage

**Common Uses**  
- RTL design (like Verilog, but with more features)  
- Writing testbenches with randomized inputs  
- Creating reusable verification components  
- Asserting properties during simulation  
- Modeling and simulating communication interfaces and protocols

**Basic Syntax Comparison**  
| Feature                | Verilog             | SystemVerilog         |  
|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|  
| Net types              | `wire`, `reg`       | `logic`, `bit`, etc.   |  
| Multi-dimensional arrays | Limited            | Full support           |  
| Loops                  | `for`, `while`      | `for`, `foreach`, `do` |  
| Structs                | Not supported       | Supported              |  
| Classes                | Not available       | Fully supported        |  



**Practical Uses of SystemVerilog**
- Used in verification environments like UVM  
- Industrial tools like Synopsys VCS, Cadence Xcelium, and Questa support it  
- Widely adopted in chip design companies for RTL and TB
